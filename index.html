          <li>Style: you can use this to change the color of a single h1 heading</li>
          <li>You can implement an entire stylesheet directly into your html file using the style element within the head element</li>
          <li>The rules will only apply to that page</li>
          <li>A single change to the CSS rule will apply to all tagged page elements</li>
          <li>Inline CSS and internal style sheets are viable in certain conditions</li>
          <li>The most common way to style a webpage is using external style sheets</li>
          <li>When using external style sheets, you'll link a file using the link element placed in the HTML's head</li>
          <li>A selector defines the element to which the rules/ declarations will apply</li>
          <li>Declarrations contain two imprtant components the CSS property we want to apply and teh value of the property ie the decloration color:blue the property is color and the value 
            for that property is blue</li>

          <li>an  array is a single variable that is used to hold a group of data, we usually use these when the data is related in some way</li>
          <li>the location of the date item in the array is the index</li>
          <li>In javascripit and other programming languages arrays start with 0 and continues sequenntially</li>
          <li>Index follows the order in which the array objects are written in the code</li>
          <li>A forr loop contains these three important statements</li>
          <li>The first statement determines the starting point for our loop since we want to start at the begining your var will alwasy = 0</li>
          <li>The second statement is the condition as long as the var is less than the length of the array the loop will keep running which allows our code to execute one time per item in the array</li>
          <li>The final statemennt is what allows the array to iterate over each item we know its a predictable pattern</li>
          <li>> the index will always increase by 1 so a short way to add one to your varriable is but just writing x++</li>
          <li>a for loop starts with for</li>
          <li>you want the code that we want to be executed for each loop inside curly brackets</li>
          <li>instead of using an actual index number just use the variable x</li>
          <li>A variable is a named container that allows us to store data in our code</li>
          <li>Control flow is the order in which a computer executes code in a script</li>
          <li>the console log command will show up in the console and you format it ('your words here')</li>
