# <Ethan's Study Guide>

## This webpage shows what I've learned during prework.


- My motivation was to get my prework done and to get a deeper understanding of all the programs we are going to be using. 
- I built this project to have my own cheat sheet to look back on during the bootcamp and I will also be adding to it the more I learn.
- It solves the problem of me not being able to memorize all elements effectively, by doing it over and over it will be easier to remember all that I learned.
- I learned the basics of HTML, CSS, and Java Script coding as well as using github and visual studio code. I also learned that the github loop is very important to keeping your work organized.

## Usage

This prework study guide can be used to look over old concepts that you're not 100% certain on. I know I will be using it for my github workzone since I'm not super comfortable with the steps yet as I find myself losing what branch I'm working in quite often.
